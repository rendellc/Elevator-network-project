Git:
  To pull submodules:
    First time: git submodule update --init --recursive
    Afterwards: git submodule update --recursive

Build simulator:
dmd -w -g src/sim_server.d src/timer_event.d -ofSimElevatorServer

Build ElevatorServer
cargo install --force ttk4145_elevator_server

TODO:
  make port determinable from id and automatic discovery of elevators
  lost connection with ElevatorServer over time. Do we suffer from this?
  simulate package lost (see cmd in mail from Jesus)
  simulate node temporarily out
  See failure mode 6
  Reduce timeOut wait time


Tests:

  Failure modes:
    1.- Some packages are lost
    2.- Elevator/Network for one module down
    3.- Elevator/Network for one module down temporarily and then comes back
    4.- Does the network module crash when ethernet is disconnected
    5.- Turning off elevator power, disconnecting motor wires
    6.- Disregarded orders:
          If placed order is disregarded more than X times after T seconds
          (no acks received), then this elevator takes order.

DONE:
  synchronize lights
  outsourcing
